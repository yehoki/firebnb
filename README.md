Airbnb-Clone using a tutorial by [Code With Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithantonio)

[Deployment on Vercel](https://firebnb-yehoki.vercel.app/)


## Tools used

- Next.js 13 with the newest app router
- React with TypeScript
- Prisma with MongoDB
- TailwindCSS for styles
- Next-Auth for credential, Google and Github authentication for users

## What I learnt
- Expanded my knowledge of using TailwindCSS for styling, which personally makes it ridiculously simple to style pages on the game, without the need to name specific classes and in turn remember what they were used for.
- Learnt a lot about how TypeScript works with React, especially when it comes to passing down props in between components, creating interfaces as well as creating specific interfaces for our database objects.
- Utilizing server and client components efficiently to make sure data from the database is loaded via server components, and then passed down in client components to maximize the speed of use.
- Further added to my React knowledge, having learnt about new hooks such as useMemo and useCallback, as well as developing my own hooks using [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) for more complex state management across the application.
